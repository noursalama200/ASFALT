#🚖 ASFALT Ride-Hailing Platform
#📌 Project Overview

ASFALT is a ride-hailing platform similar to Uber, designed to provide both riders and drivers with flexibility, transparency, and freedom of choice.

The system allows riders to book trips from pickup to destination, calculate trip costs in advance, and select from various car types with different hourly rates. Drivers can track their earnings, participate in competitions, and enjoy promotional incentives.

The platform also considers personal preferences (e.g., no pets, no smokers) to ensure maximum comfort and compatibility between riders and drivers.
